*Day 4: Via negativia; today, pick a habit that you’d like to eliminate from your life. Bad habits are like armpits, we all have ‘em and they all stink. Whether cutting soda out of your life, or putting a stop to your porn addiction; either way, as with yesterday, think about the steps you’ll take in order to put the kibosh on that negative habit. And again, also think about how you’ll keep yourself accountable to that goal.*

When I first started thinking about this, I thought that it would be no problem to stop biting my nails or cut out Diet Coke.  I know from previous experience how difficult each of those are.  Plus, while they may make me slightly better, I think something better to eliminate from my life (and the lives of those around me) would be me interrupting.  Specifically, I'm going to stop interrupting Hilary.  I can't figure a good way for me to keep myself accountable on this goal.  The only way I can think is to have Hilary remind me every time that she notices it.
