*Day 10: Take a look at the [hero’s journey](http://www.artofmanliness.com/2013/07/11/heros-journey/), and identify where you are in that journey. Doing so can help you better understand where you are in life, and help you figure out where to go next. You can take it in the context of your entire life, or you can take it in the context of a certain phase of your life. Either way, you can be sure that you’re part of a greater journey, and knowing what comes next can help guide you along.*

After reading through these stages, I think that I am still in The Ordeal: the central conflict in the story, the big boss fight, where the possibility of death is imminent.  

I think that not only because according to the Warrior Ethos, I could have my life put in danger at any time but because if I look at my 20's as the journey, I see joining the Air Force as my main journey that satisfies most of these steps.  The one thing that I find notably absent is the mentor.  I can't say that I've had a mentor ever.

I suppose the closest person to a mentor that I have is Robert Davis but I have never mentioned it to him and know very little about him.  What I do know is that he lives a life-style that I want to live.  I know that he treats people kindly.  I know that he loves his wife.  I know that he raised a well adjusted son.  When I move back to Louisville, I hope to develop a closer relationship with him.

Looking ahead to exiting the military, there will be a period of adjustment.  In the military, my life is governed by regulations both in and out of uniform.  I can be punished at work for things that happen outside of work.  I worry that when I leave the military, I will be directionless and paralyzed by fear of failure.  I feel that the military provides me a safety net to try things without failing.
