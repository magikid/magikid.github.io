*Day 15: Come up with your own Cabinet of Invisible Counselors. There are innumerable great men from history who we can learn from today. When thinking about your life or pondering some question or problem, yes, go to actual mentors and friends, but also take in the advice of men of yore. Write out who you would have on your list and what you admire about them. Having trouble coming up with a list? The comments in the post should offer plenty of ideas.*

On my cabinet of invisible counselors, I would at least have Teddy Roosevelt on it.  I'm not sure who else from history that I would turn to for advice.  I suppose that if it is an imaginary counsel, I'd also ask for the Buddha.  

I still haven't given this post much thought.  I suppose that I would choose Teddy due to his pragmatism.  I've recently read a biography of him and he seems to have always looked for a level-headed solution to the problems that faced him.

And the Buddha would make it on my counsel because of his wisdom.
