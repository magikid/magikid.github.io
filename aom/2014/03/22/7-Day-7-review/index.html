<pre><code>Part of this doesn't apply to me since I'm not journaling daily but rather weekly.  I have enjoyed journaling weekly.  I especially like this prompt format and in the future, I may reuse some of these prompts if I can't think of anything to write about.  For the most part, writing has been easy for me as usual.  
The hardest part has been getting a good number in [Beeminder](beeminder.com) so that I would remember that I needed to journal.  I have found that putting up $5 is good incentive to get me to journal.  And not just journaling has encouraged by Beeminder.  I have also started studying Russian more due to it.  Although $5 isn't a lot, it is certainly motivating enough since if I fall off the path, I don't even get something out of that money.
Journaling has been exactly what I expected and wanted.  I was looking for a way for me to express my personality and thought processes in a written fashion.  I really enjoyed reading Granddad's story of what he did in WWII.  What I was left with after reading it though, was questions about the why's behind his decisions so even though I am not doing anything (too) exciting with my life, I want anyone reading this to understand why I made the decisions I did and what kind of person that I am.

And now for something completely different.  I am currently in ALS.  I have been working my butt off this week.  It was the fourth of five weeks so we had several writing assignments and tests.  I passed them all (so far) and was looking forward to a relaxing weekend but it wasn't meant to be.  I was forced to wake up at my normal weekday alarm of 0530 so that I could be at a volunteer event in DC for 0700.  I am so exhausted and out of it that I wonder if this weekend will be rejuvenatory at all.  I just hope that tomorrow I can lounge around and casually study.
